Git Conflicts
    - main reason of conflict occurence is modifying same directory/file 
      in different branch and trying to merging it

Made a Local repository , and pushed it to my Github : https://github.com/ravi-ndra/Ruby
Pulled repository after updating on Remote Repository
Made a new branch, modified one file and merged branch with main branch
