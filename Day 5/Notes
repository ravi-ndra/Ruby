Variables
    - Global variables : they have global scope , and can be accessed everywhere
                         Begins with symbol '$'
                         Uninitialized global variables have nil value
    - Instance variable: Does not need to be initialized first
                         Begins with symbol '@'
                         Can be accessed by any specific class
    - Class Variable   : Can be accessed by class and it's characteristics
                         Begins with symbol '@@'
                         Need to be initialized first
    - Local variable   : Local variable have scope of any specific class, def, do or within any block
    - Constant variable: Starts with uppercase
                         Caonstants variables defined with in class can be accessed within the class
                         And global constant variable can be accessed globaly
                         Constant can not be defined within methods

Class
    - It's blueprint for any Object , and from which objects can be created.
    - Class starts with keyword 'class' and class name must be with Initial Capital
        ex : class Student
             end
    - To create objects from class
        ex : class Student
                #code
             end

             st1 = Student.new
             st2 = Student.new
    - Class initialize method : - It is same as constructor
                                - It would preceded by 'def' keyword 
                                - It also may take list of parameters
                                - Used when one wants to initialize some class variables 
                                  at the time of object creation.
                                - Ex : class Box
                                            def initialize(w,h)    
                                                @width, @height = w, h
                                            end
                                        end
    - Instance variables in class : Ex : class Box
                                            def initialize(w,h) 
                                            #assign instance variables
                                                @width, @height = w, h
                                            end
                                        end
                                    - can be accessed using '@' operator within class 
                                    - to access outside class public methods are Used 
                                      which are called "accessor methods"
    - Accessor and setter methods : - accessor method is getter method
    - class variable              : - it have scope of class and cannot be used outside class
    - self method                 : - It is used to call this method form class 
                                      without creating any object 
                                      Ex : class Box
                                           ...
                                            def self.methodName()
                                                #code
                                            end
                                           ...

                                           Box.methodName()
    - to_s method                 : - to return string representation of that object
                                    - Ex : class Box
                                                def initialize(w,h)
                                                    @width, @height = w, h
                                                end
                                                def to_s
                                                    "(w:#@width,h:#@height)" # string formatting of object
                                                end
                                            end
                                            box = Box.new(10, 20)
                                            puts "String representation of box is : #{box}"

Access Control
    - Public    : - By default methods are public (Except initialize method which is always private)
                  - public methods can be called by anyone
    - Private   : - Only class methods can access private members
                  - can not be accessed or viewed from outside class
    - Protected : -Can be invoked only by objects of defining class and it's subclasses


OOPs
    1. Inheritance : 
                - Inheritance is used when we want to reuse the class methods and data in another class
                - When one class inherits all methods and properties of another class it is called Inheritance.
                - In Ruby to in inherit class '<' symbol is used
                    Ex : class Vehicle
                        end
                        class Bike < Vehicle 
                        end
                * Method Overriding : - Inheritance when both class have method with same name than the method 
                                        which is in derived class will override the method form parent class.
                * Freezzing objects : - when we don's want any object to be modified letter, freeze can be used
                                      - To freeze object use : Object.freeze
                                      - After freeze object can not be modified
                                      - to check if Object is forzen or not use : Object.forzen?
